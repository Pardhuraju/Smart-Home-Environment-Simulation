# Smart-Home-Environment-Simulation
This Python program simulates a smart home system where an AI agent monitors environmental conditions like time of day, temperature, presence, and natural light. Based on these inputs, it automatically controls lights, thermostat, and door locks. Users can interactively change conditions to see real-time AI decisions.
